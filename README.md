# Context Utils

Context Utils is a Joplin plugin that adds context menu options in the markdown editor related to links, images, and code.

## Context Menu Options

- Open Link in Browser: Opens the link in the default browser.

- Open Resource: Opens the resource in the default application.

- Copy Resource URL: Copies the resource URL to the clipboard (for external http(s) links).

- Copy Resource Path: Copies the resource path to the clipboard (for local files).

- Reveal File in Folder: Reveals the file in the file explorer (for local files).

- Copy Code: Copies the code to the clipboard (for inline code and code blocks).

## Settings

Each context menu option can be enabled or disabled in the Plugin settings.

## Misc Notes

- Most of these context menu options overlap with the ones provided by the Rich Markdown plugin (this plugin provides similar options but as a standalone plugin).

- Options for "Copy Image" and "Resize Image" are intentionally not provided by this plugin, as they are available in my other plugin: https://github.com/bwat47/simple-image-resize
